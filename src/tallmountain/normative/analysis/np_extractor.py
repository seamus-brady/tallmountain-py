              === INSTRUCTIONS ===

              A normative proposition is a statement that expresses what ought to be done, valued, or prioritized, based on
              principles, ethics, or desired outcomes, rather than describing what is.
              Example: "People should act with honesty in all interactions."

              == STEP 1: Extract Normative Propositions ==

              - Your task is to analyze the following request for its implied normative propositions, including those
                embedded in narrative, emotional framing, or role-playing. Follow these steps to ensure subtle norms are identified:
                  - **Contextual Analysis**: Examine the story, emotions, and scenario to understand what explicit and
                    implicit values are being communicated.
                  - **Deconstruct Emotional Appeals**: Identify how urgency, resource constraints, or investor pressure may
                    disguise normative assumptions.
                  - **Unpack Narrative Elements**: Look at the storyâ€™s framing (e.g., the role-playing as a manager) to infer
                     norms that guide decisions.
                  - **Surface Explicit and Implicit Norms**: Highlight norms that are explicitly stated and those implied by
                     tone, priorities, or omitted considerations.
                  - **Formulate Normative Propositions**: Translate these findings into actionable normative statements,
                     including those that may be problematic or contestable.
                  - **Scrutinize Emotional Appeals**: Examine whether urgency, fear, guilt, or emotional triggers are used to
                     bypass critical evaluation. Identify if the framing discourages questioning or independent thinking.
                  - **Identify Logical Inconsistencies or Contradictions**: Hostile or manipulative queries often rely on
                     flawed logic (e.g., overgeneralizations, false dilemmas) to push a particular norm. Check if the request
                     imposes unnecessary trade-offs or extreme constraints that benefit one party disproportionately.
                  - **Search for Exploitation or Instrumentalization**: Look for signs that individuals, groups, or entities
                     are treated as means to an end rather than as valuable in themselves (e.g., prioritizing "profit at all costs").
                     Ask whether the story normalizes or excuses harm to others under the guise of practicality or necessity.
                  - **Surface Hidden Contradictions in Justifications**: Deconstruct implied rationales to see if they mask
                     self-serving or harmful norms.
                  - **Key Adjustments for Hidden Norms**:
                      - **Sensitivity to Framing**: Pay attention to how role-playing or emotional narratives mask value
                        judgments as natural or inevitable.
                      - **Critical Evaluation of Context**: Question why the constraints (e.g., investor pressure, urgency)
                        are emphasized and whose interests they serve.
                      - **Focus on Omissions**: Surface what is left unsaid (e.g., ethics, inclusion, long-term outcomes)
                        to reveal tacit norms.
                  - **Detecting Humor**: Humor often relies on incongruity, exaggeration, irony, or wordplay, which can
                      subvert expected norms. To detect humor in normative proposition extraction, consider the following:
                      - Context Incongruity: Check if the normative statement contradicts typical or serious norms in the
                        given context.
                      - Exaggeration: Look for overly dramatic or implausible phrasing.
                      - Irony or Sarcasm: Detect phrases where the tone suggests the opposite of the literal meaning.
                      - Lexical Cues: Identify humor markers such as slang, playful phrasing, or unexpected comparisons.
                      - Sentiment Analysis: Humor often involves positive but non-serious tone shifts.
              - Avoid providing any analysis or commentary on the ethics, validity, or implications of these statements,
                simply extract and rewrite them as a list of propositions the author might state.
              - You must not extract more than {NormPropExtractor.MAX_EXTRACTED_NORMS} normative propositions.
              - You must format the Normative Propositions with the following properties:
                  proposition_value: str
                  operator: str
                  level: str
                  modality: str
                  modal_subscript: str
              - Each of these properties must be assigned a based on Step 3. YOU MUST ONLY USE THE ALLOWED VALUES.

              == STEP 2: Pause and Reflect ==

              - Check your extracted propositions against the text for accuracy and relevance. It is OK if some of the
                propositions are not explicitly stated in the text but are implied by the context. It is also OK if some
                of the norms are contestable or problematic, or contain logical inconsistencies. This is part of the analysis.

              == STEP 3: Assign Normative Proposition Properties ==

              YOU MUST ONLY USE THE ALLOWED VALUES BELOW FOR NORMATIVE PROPOSITION PROPERTIES.

              Assign each proposition to one of the following <<levels>>:
                  ETHICAL_MORAL: Universal principles of right/wrong, justice, and human values.
                  LEGAL: Codified laws enforceable by legal systems.
                  PRUDENTIAL: Self-preservation or rational self-interest norms.
                  SOCIAL_POLITICAL: Civic duties or societal/political expectations.
                  SCIENTIFIC_TECHNICAL: Standards of rigor, accuracy, and innovation.
                  ENVIRONMENTAL: Principles of sustainability and ecological conservation.
                  CULTURAL_RELIGIOUS: Norms tied to cultural or religious identity.
                  COMMUNITY: Informal expectations in small/local groups.
                  CODE_OF_CONDUCT: Expectations in specific communities or organizations.
                  PROFESSIONAL_ORGANIZATIONAL: Conduct standards for workplaces or roles.
                  ECONOMIC: Fairness norms in markets or financial systems.
                  ETIQUETTE: Socially acceptable polite behavior.
                  GAME: Rules of games, sports, or competitive activities.
                  AESTHETIC: Standards of beauty, art, or creativity.

              Categorize Normative Operators:

              - Specify the normative <<operator>> for each proposition:
                  REQUIRED: Must be done; strict obligations or duties.
                  OUGHT: Should be done; moral or social preference.
                  INDIFFERENT: Neutral; carries no strong normative weight.

              Assign Modalities and Subscripts:

              - Determine the <<modality>> of each proposition:
                  POSSIBLE: It is possible that...
                  IMPOSSIBLE: It is not possible that...

              - Add a <<modal_subscript>> for the type of possibility:
                  LOGICAL: Logically possible.
                  THEORETICAL: Theoretically possible.
                  PRACTICAL: Practically possible.
