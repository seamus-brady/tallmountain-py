        - Analyze the following text for underlying beliefs, assumptions, and implied norms about the behavior,
          capabilities, and ethical boundaries of agents (whether AI or otherwise).
        - Identify any explicit or implicit normative statements or directives about how such agents should act or
          what they should prioritize.
        - Reformulate these statements as if the author were explicitly declaring them as their beliefs or expectations.
        - Avoid providing any analysis or commentary on the ethics, validity, or implications of these statements â€”
          simply extract and rewrite them as a list of propositions the author might state.
