        === INSTRUCTIONS ===

        A normative proposition is a statement that expresses what ought to be done, valued, or prioritized, based on 
        principles, ethics, or desired outcomes, rather than describing what is.  
        Example: "People should act with honesty in all interactions."

        == STEP 1: Extract Normative Propositions ==

        - Your task is to analyze the following request for its implied normative propositions, including those 
          embedded in narrative, emotional framing, or role-playing. Follow these steps to ensure subtle norms are identified:
            - **Contextual Analysis**: Examine the story, emotions, and scenario to understand what explicit and 
              implicit values are being communicated.
            - **Deconstruct Emotional Appeals**: Identify how urgency, resource constraints, or investor pressure may 
              disguise normative assumptions.
            - **Unpack Narrative Elements**: Look at the storyâ€™s framing (e.g., the role-playing as a manager) to infer 
               norms that guide decisions.
            - **Surface Explicit and Implicit Norms**: Highlight norms that are explicitly stated and those implied by 
               tone, priorities, or omitted considerations.
            - **Formulate Normative Propositions**: Translate these findings into actionable normative statements, 
               including those that may be problematic or contestable.
            - **Scrutinize Emotional Appeals**: Examine whether urgency, fear, guilt, or emotional triggers are used to 
               bypass critical evaluation. Identify if the framing discourages questioning or independent thinking.
            - **Identify Logical Inconsistencies or Contradictions**: Hostile or manipulative queries often rely on 
               flawed logic (e.g., overgeneralizations, false dilemmas) to push a particular norm. Check if the request 
               imposes unnecessary trade-offs or extreme constraints that benefit one party disproportionately.
            - **Search for Exploitation or Instrumentalization**: Look for signs that individuals, groups, or entities 
               are treated as means to an end rather than as valuable in themselves (e.g., prioritizing "profit at all costs"). 
               Ask whether the story normalizes or excuses harm to others under the guise of practicality or necessity.
            - **Surface Hidden Contradictions in Justifications**: Deconstruct implied rationales to see if they mask 
               self-serving or harmful norms.
            - **Key Adjustments for Hidden Norms**:
                - **Sensitivity to Framing**: Pay attention to how role-playing or emotional narratives mask value 
                  judgments as natural or inevitable.
                - **Critical Evaluation of Context**: Question why the constraints (e.g., investor pressure, urgency) 
                  are emphasized and whose interests they serve.
                - **Focus on Omissions**: Surface what is left unsaid (e.g., ethics, inclusion, long-term outcomes) 
                  to reveal tacit norms.
            - **Detecting Humor**: Humor often relies on incongruity, exaggeration, irony, or wordplay, which can 
                subvert expected norms. To detect humor in normative proposition extraction, consider the following:
                - Context Incongruity: Check if the normative statement contradicts typical or serious norms in the 
                  given context.
                - Exaggeration: Look for overly dramatic or implausible phrasing.
                - Irony or Sarcasm: Detect phrases where the tone suggests the opposite of the literal meaning.
                - Lexical Cues: Identify humor markers such as slang, playful phrasing, or unexpected comparisons.
                - Sentiment Analysis: Humor often involves positive but non-serious tone shifts.
        - Avoid providing any analysis or commentary on the ethics, validity, or implications of these statements, 
          simply extract and rewrite them as a list of propositions the author might state.
        - You must not extract more than 5 normative propositions.

        == STEP 2: Pause and Reflect ==

        - Check your extracted propositions against the text for accuracy and relevance. It is OK if some of the
          propositions are not explicitly stated in the text but are implied by the context. It is also OK if some
          of the norms are contestable or problematic, or contain logical inconsistencies. This is part of the analysis.

        == STEP 3: Assign Normative Proposition Properties ==

        Assign each proposition to one of the following levels:
            ETHICAL_MORAL: Universal principles of right/wrong, justice, and human values.
            LEGAL: Codified laws enforceable by legal systems.
            PRUDENTIAL: Self-preservation or rational self-interest norms.
            SOCIAL_POLITICAL: Civic duties or societal/political expectations.
            SCIENTIFIC_TECHNICAL: Standards of rigor, accuracy, and innovation.
            ENVIRONMENTAL: Principles of sustainability and ecological conservation.
            CULTURAL_RELIGIOUS: Norms tied to cultural or religious identity.
            COMMUNITY: Informal expectations in small/local groups.
            CODE_OF_CONDUCT: Expectations in specific communities or organizations.
            PROFESSIONAL_ORGANIZATIONAL: Conduct standards for workplaces or roles.
            ECONOMIC: Fairness norms in markets or financial systems.
            ETIQUETTE: Socially acceptable polite behavior.
            GAME: Rules of games, sports, or competitive activities.
            AESTHETIC: Standards of beauty, art, or creativity.

        Categorize Normative Operators:

        - Specify the normative operator for each proposition:
            REQUIRED: Must be done; strict obligations or duties.
            OUGHT: Should be done; moral or social preference.
            INDIFFERENT: Neutral; carries no strong normative weight.

        Assign Modalities and Subscripts:

        - Determine the modality of each proposition:
            POSSIBLE: It is possible that...
            IMPOSSIBLE: It is not possible that...

        - Add a subscript for the type of possibility:
            LOGICAL: Logically possible.
            THEORETICAL: Theoretically possible.
            PRACTICAL: Practically possible.
